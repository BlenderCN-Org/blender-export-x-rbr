# Blender Export X for Richard Burns Rally
Blender 2.79 addon that prepares (splits into chunks, does necessary transformations, separates by materials, configures DirectX exporter etc.) and exports a game mesh (ground, general, collision) to DirectX format (using built-in DirectX exporter), so it can be directly imported to the game editor.
